# Deep Learning with Python 2.1 #

 ## 2.1 A first look at a neural network

> In this chapter, they are going to solve is to classify images of handwritten digits (28*28 pixels), into their 10 categories (0-9).
>
> The datasets they will use is the MNIST dataset (https://s3.amazonaws.com/img-datasets/mnist.npz), where the datasets comes pre-loaded in Keras, in the form of Numpy arrays.
>
> Workflow will be as follow. 
>
> 1. First they will present their neural network with the training data (train_images and train_labels). The network will learn to associate images and labels. 
> 2. Then they will ask the network to produce predictions for test_images. They will verify if these predictions match the labels from test_labels. 

> Start building the network.
>
> Import the layers/ models from Keras.
>
> Keras has two main available models : **The sequential model** and **the Model class used with the functional API**. They use sequential model in this example.
>
> Layer is the core building block of neural networks, a data-preprocessing module.
>
> When the data comes in, it will output in a more useful form.
>
> Our network consists of a sequence of two layers. The first one is fully-connected neural layers, activation function is relu (Rectifie Linear Units). The second one is a 10-way layer, activation function is softmax, it will return an array of 10 probability scores, each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.
>
> Pick three more things to make their network ready for training.
>
> 1. A loss function: this is how the network will be able to measure how good a job it is doing on its training data, and thus how it will be able to steer itself in the right direction. 
> 2.  An optimizer: this is the mechanism through which the network will update itself based on the data it sees and its loss function. 
> 3.  Metrics to monitor during training and testing. Here we will only care about accuracy (the fraction of the images that were correctly classified).
